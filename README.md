# PySpeak: A Python library for Speaker Verification

This work was inspired by [this repository](https://github.com/dominoanty/SpeakerRecognition).

# How to use it?

- `data`: Place you files in the ubm, enrollment and test folders:
	- the file name for UBM does not matter, but should be WAV files
	- the name of the test and enrollment files should be the name of the speaker + _ + the id of the utterance, in a WAV format
